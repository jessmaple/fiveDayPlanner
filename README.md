Five Day Planner is a browser-based planning application. This productivity tool is used to assist working professionals and students with their daily schedules.

# Motivation

I am a busy student, working professional, and full-time bootcamp student. My schedule can get pretty busy and it can be very easy to forget important dates and appointments. To combat this issue, I created Five Day Planner. This application was created to help organize my days and improve accountablity.
